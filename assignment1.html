  <div class = "h2"> <h2>General Bio</h2>
    <p> Hello and Welcome! My name is Anthony (Arhim) Wilson <br>
      and I am a junior at the University of Redlands. As a yearning <br>
      and egar Computer Science BA major, I am trying to expand my <br>
      coding knowledge through the realms of story telling in hopes <br>
      of better understanding on what makes a videogame something relatable <br>
      and somewhat personal to the gamer. <br>  </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "h3"> <h3>Projects I've previously worked on </h3>
      <p> I haven't made any games yet <br>
        but some ideas I have devloped <br>
        creatively include: <br> <br>
      </p>
      <p> Amoung the Sand dunes</p>
      <br>

    <div class = "h4"> <h4> What I've done at Redlands </h4>
      <br>
      <p> "Another home away from home", I always say. <br>
      My time at U of R has challenge me in so many ways <br>
    artistically and mentally. While attending the University,<br>
      I was able to develop the first ever color guard organization, <br>
      partake in a Stage Design class (where I helped influence <br>
      the makings of a brand new class), and demonstrate to <br>
      to a strict Nonficition class the blend of fictional <br>
      and nonficition flares within stories. </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "h5"> <h5> Hobbies and Artwork </h5>
      <p> If I'm drowning in my studies, I often draw,
      write, sing, do origami, dance, and, like every
      human being (I hope), socialize and empower my
      friends. Below are some pieces of artwork and
      sample writings. </p> <br>
